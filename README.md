#Hello World Tutorial

- To run the chrome extension, go to chrome://extensions and then toggle developer mode on (at the top right corner)
- Then click the button "Load Unpacked" in the top left corner and add the directory where your extension code is (the directory where you hello.html and manifest.json file is)
- Now simply click the extensions tab in the chrome navbar as you do for any other extension and click your extension, which will display the hello world popup.
